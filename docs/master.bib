abstract = {Often software systems are developed by organizations consisting of many teams of individuals working together. Brooks states in the Mythical Man Month book that product quality is strongly affected by organization structure. Unfortunately there has been little empirical evidence to date to substantiate this assertion. In this paper we present a metric scheme to quantify organizational complexity, in relation to the product development process to identify if the metrics impact failure-proneness. In our case study, the organizational metrics when applied to data from Windows Vista were statistically significant predictors of failure-proneness. The precision and recall measures for identifying failure-prone binaries, using the organizational metrics, was significantly higher than using traditional metrics like churn, complexity, coverage, dependencies, and pre-release bug measures that have been used to date to predict failure-proneness. Our results provide empirical evidence that the organizational metrics are related to, and are effective predictors of failure-proneness.},

abstract = {The right to fork open source code is at the core of open source licensing. All open source licenses grant the right to fork their code, that is to start a new development effort using an existing code as its base. Thus, code forking represents the single greatest tool available for guaranteeing sustainability in open source software. In addition to bolstering program sus- tainability, code forking directly affects the governance of open source initiatives. Forking, and even the mere possibility of forking code, affects the governance and sustainability of open source initiatives on three distinct levels: software, community, and ecosystem. On the software level, the right to fork makes planned obsolescence, versioning, vendor lock- in, end-of-support issues, and similar initiatives all but impossible to implement. On the community level, forking impacts both sustainability and governance through the power it grants the community to safeguard against unfavourable actions by corporations or pro- ject leaders. On the business-ecosystem level forking can serve as a catalyst for innovation while simultaneously promoting better quality software through natural selection. Thus, forking helps keep open source initiatives relevant and presents opportunities for the de- velopment and commercialization of current and abandoned programs.},

abstract = {Many organisations are dependent upon long-term sustainable software systems and associated communities. In this paper we consider long-term sustainability of Open Source software communities in Open Source software projects involving a fork. There is currently a lack of studies in the literature that address how specific Open Source software communities are affected by a fork. We report from a study aiming to investigate the developer community around the LibreOffice project, which is a fork from the OpenOffice.org project. In so doing, our analysis also covers the OpenOffice.org project and the related Apache OpenOffice project. The results strongly suggest a long-term sustainable LibreOffice community and that there are no signs of stagnation in the LibreOffice project 33 months after the fork. Our analysis provides details on developer communities for the LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice projects and specifically concerning how they have evolved from the OpenOffice.org community with respect to project activity, developer commitment, and retention of committers over time. Further, we present results from an analysis of first hand experiences from contributors in the LibreOffice community. Findings from our analysis show that Open Source software communities can outlive Open Source software projects and that LibreOffice is perceived by its community as supportive, diversified, and independent. The study contributes new insights concerning challenges related to long-term sustainability of Open Source software communities. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Biological and software systems share a common property from evolution: they need to change and adapt to either a new environment or a new requirement. If the environment or requirement changes, those systems that have high evolvability will survive and others will be eliminated. The evolvability of a biological system has been widely studied and shown to be dependent on several properties: self-organization, modularity, gene duplication, gene robustness, and symbiosis. This position paper discusses the evolvability of a software system with respect to these properties. Our study shows that software systems share similar evolvability properties with biological systems. We conclude that studying and comparing the internal structures as well as the overall evolution process of these biological systems can help us understand software systems from a holistic 'product-lifecycle' perspective thereby helping us develop software systems with better evolvability traits},

abstract = {All comparative analyses rely on at least one phylogenetic hypothesis. However, the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of species is not the pri-mary aim of these studies. In fact, it is rarely the case that a well-resolved, fully matching phylogeny is available for the interspecific trait data at hand. Therefore, phylogenetic information usually needs to be combined across various sources that often rely on different approaches and different markers for the phylogenetic reconstruction. Building hypotheses about the evolutionary history of species is a challenging task, as it requires knowledge about the underlying methodology and an ability to flexibly manipulate data in diverse formats. Although most practi-tioners are not experts in phylogenetics, the appropriate handling of phylogenetic information is crucial for making evolutionary inferences in a comparative study, because the results will be proportional to the underlying phylogeny. In this chapter, we provide an overview on how to interpret and combine phylogenetic information from different sources, and review the various tree-tailoring tech-niques by touching upon issues that are crucial for the understanding of other chapters in this book. We conclude that whichever method is used to generate trees, the phylogenetic hypotheses will always include some uncertainty that should be taken into account in a comparative study.},

Thus, its ability to cope with customers' ever-changing requirements is among its key success factors. Great effort has been made to deal with the software product line evolution. In our previous works, we carried out a classification of these works to provide an overview of the used techniques. We also identified the following key challenges of software product lines evolution: the ability to predict future changes, the ability to define the impact of a change easily and the improvement in understanding the change. We have already tackled the second and the third challenges. The objective of this paper is to deal with the first challenge. We use the cladistics classification which was used in biology to understand the evolution of organisms sharing the same ancestor and their process of descent at the aim of predicting their future changes. By analogy, we consider a population of applications for media management on mobile devices derived from the same platform and we use cladistics to construct their evolutionary tree. We conducted an analysis to show how to identify the evolution trends of the case study products and to predict future changes.},
