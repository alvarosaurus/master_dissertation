I am extremely grateful to the Open University staff, who have provided me with such professional and well informed support. Special mention must be made of my tutor, Dr. Doug Leith, whose guidance has been invaluable throughout. I also would like to thank my colleagues at the Technical University Berlin, in particular Erhard Zorn and Dr. Stefan Born, for balancing a busy workload. I am especially thankful for the encouragement shown by my family and in particular for the patience afforded me by my dear friend Ina Kemter.
