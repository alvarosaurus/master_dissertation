# Master dissertation
These are the source LaTeX files for my master in software engineering, which I uploaded here under an [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY-SA 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, as a question of [reproducible research](https://cos.io/our-services/top-guidelines/) and because the dissertation delves into open source development.

The dissertation was accepted by the Open University UK on 28 November 2017.
